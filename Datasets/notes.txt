Step 1: 

Plot in strides of 10 / 20 (Draft 1 - 60, 6 categories / Draft 1 - 60, 3 categories) vs each feature individually 

Result : Features most important to distungish between top prospect from the rest 

Step 2: 

Use these features vs Draft Pick Number to create a regression plot -> Then Predict Top Prospect

Step 3: 

Benchmark above against : All features vs Draft Pick Number to create a regression plot -> Then Predict Top Prospect

Step 4:

Perform supervised clustering to group these categories to the best possible fit -> Check by seeing which category a prospect falls into
